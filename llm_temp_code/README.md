# llm_temp_code/

Temporary directory for LLM-generated exploration scripts and data summaries during interactive sessions.

**Purpose:** Store ephemeral code snippets and notes created during LLM-assisted analysis. Files here are not part of the core pipeline and may be deleted at any time.

**Usage:** Place temporary Python or R scripts here when exploring data interactively. Move finalized code to the appropriate location in the main repository.
